This is my minimal template that I use for all my new projects.

It has:

- [tsdown](https://tsdown.dev) for easily bundling code
- node:test for testing
- All the editor configurations you might need
- Automatic code formatting on committing with prettier and simple-git-hooks

# Use

Run `copy.ts` with deno:

```shell
deno run --no-lock -A copy.ts [path to new project]
```
